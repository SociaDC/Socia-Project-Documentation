<h3 id="_once_upon_a_git">Once upon a Git.</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git as it is today is a distributed version control system, created for code collaboration processes.
Todays developers are using tools such as GitHub, GitLab or even BitBucket, but what if i tell you that those iterations of version management platforms are not implementing the core principles of git? What if i tell you that the "Inventor" of git, the allmighty Linus Torvald was so fed up by the idea of a centraliced code collab service that he tried to develop his own system?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter is all about Gits origins and how modern code collab has developed over time.
If you are just interested in code examples and git implementation strategies please skip this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before Git there was nothing but Emptiness &#8230;&#8203;..
Early VCS (Version control systems) started in the 1970s <strong>(35 before git)</strong>
where its first iteration called SCCS (Source Code Control System) was on the rise.
Its very basic version tracking system, was only designed to work on linux and had very limited features. The core principle of storing your projects history has been born.
VCS next iteration (RCS) - Revision Control System added branches and merging but still was only designed to upload individual files and was very limited in its usage.
CVS an extended VCS version included concurrent development and collaboration but suffered from severe performance issues. And the last of its kind SVN is able to get rid of the previous iteration mistakes. Its performance was better and was way more reliable. However its centralized structure was doomed to failure for any large scaled environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the early days of the Linux Kernel, its community was using a VCS tool called BitKeeper. BitKeeper was a proprietary piece of software that suited the needs of the kernels development team. But it was not all bees and flowers. After a licensing dispute, the company behind BitKeeper decided to remove its free version out of their software palette. Therefore the Team behind Linux, desperatly needed a new Distributed Code Management tool.
Linus Torvald the infamous Linux founder, was sure that he would be able to create his own vcs service and while creating, he focused on a few different points.
- Speed
The new system should be able to handle large data repositories with numerious commits efficiently
- Distributed Architecture
The Projects architecture shouldnt be dependent on one central server but rather be copied onto every developers machine.
- Data Integrity
Ensuring Repositories data integrity and security
- Support for non Linear Development
Complex branching and merging should be included</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These Objectives formed the idea of <strong>"Git"</strong> which has been published since 2005.
You will later see how linus torvald intended the system to be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_structure_of_git_big_boy_remote_origin">Structure of Git (Big boy - Remote , Origin &#8230;&#8203;)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Example where i create a git repo by hand without git init&#8230;&#8203;)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we start digging into specific commandlets and execution examples, we have to understand how git operates.
The Git system is always initalized by using the command</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git init</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is mostly responsible to prepare to operation environment of git.
It includes the creation of a .git repository, as well as the subdirectories <strong>refs/tags, refs/heads and objects</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It needs a file HEAD in which you need to specify your current branch:
&gt;ref: refs/heads/master</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this your git structure is initialized.
(When using the git bash, it s visually highlighted by showing the current branch as main)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These component types (tags / heads / objects) all serve different purposes.
While tags are literal pointers that are used to highlight one specific commit as "v1.0", branch-heads act not that different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When understanding how changes actually reach their destination you have to know that there are 3 stages in which commits can be.
- The origin (your pcs working directory)
- The  staging area (reached through <strong>git add .</strong>)
- The repository (reached through <strong>git commit .</strong> )
- The remote (external service &#8658; leaves your PC with <strong>git push</strong>)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Originally linus torvald intended the system to work without any centralized Server that is responsible to store all of the developers data.
In his mind, developers would send their requests, commits and branches from one pc to another, so that any developer is able to access their state of the application without using such server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_commit">What is a Commit</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Commits are Nodes that save changed information.
They always except for one time have to be based on another commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="assets/images/Commit.png" alt="Commit" width="300">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Commit</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A node also contains, a rsa id which is used to identify the signed commit.
This RSA id includes the information of date, author, changed content as well as its predecessor which leads to a unique key identifier.
As each file would be repetetive to save, git just saves the changes of each individual file, therefore each commit is necessary to rebuild the whole application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_branch">What is a Branch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a branch is always visually displayed by a stream of commits.
In theory that would be correct, but its technical realization looks a bit different.
Commits are never meant to save their predestined branch, as one commit can be present in multiple branches.
To be more accurate, branches are nothing else than so called "heads"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These Heads act as pointers on dedicated commits.
If you create a new Branch from master, there is just one Pointer being added to the system directing to the last commit accessed.
After commiting again, the new commit is getting pointed at by our new branch, while the previous one maintains beeing the head of master and so on.
Because of that "diverging Branches" are just branches that focus on different commits, that somewhere had the same past (commit history).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each Branch header also has a unique SHA-1 hashed identifier.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_are_branches_and_how_to_create_delete_them">What are Branches and how to create / Delete Them</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a real scenario you are able to create branches in two ways.
By using the cli in which you have to create the branch by hand.
&gt;git checkout -b "feature-name"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or by creating it directly in the github web ui.
<strong>Go to Branches &gt; new Branch and choose your origin.</strong></p>

<h4 id="_merge_strategies_when_to_use_each_interactive_rebase_squash">Merge strategies - When to use each (+ Interactive rebase / Squash)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have already discussed what branches are and how they work.
But we have not solved the question, what benefits they should provide for the development team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As one of Gits main features branches are made to make code collaboration more easy.
Branches come in play to reduce the cost of working together by letting you base your changes temporarily on a different state of the application.
But what should i do when i am done developing a feature in my branch?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section git becomes a bit tricky, there are several branch merging strategies that are all valuable in their own way.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge Commit</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Combines the specified branch&#8217;s history into the current branch, creating a new commit to record the merge. This method preserves the history of both branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast-forward Merge</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git merge --ff-only &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Moves the current branch tip forward to the target branch tip if there are no divergent changes. This does not create a merge commit. If a fast-forward merge is not possible, the merge fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Squash Merge</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git merge --squash &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Combines all the changes from the specified branch into a single commit on the current branch, which must then be manually committed. This method results in a cleaner, more linear history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No Fast-forward Merge</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git merge --no-ff &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible. This method is useful for preserving the complete history of feature branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rebase</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git rebase &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Moves the current branch&#8217;s commits to the tip of the specified branch, effectively reapplying the changes from the current branch on top of the other branch. This creates a linear history but can be more complex to resolve conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interactive Rebase</strong>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>git rebase -i &lt;commit&gt;</code> or <code>git rebase -i &lt;branch&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Opens an editor to allow for more granular control over how commits are applied. You can reorder, squash, edit, or drop commits. This method is useful for cleaning up commit history before merging.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the use of <code>PRs</code> or <code>Pull Requests</code>, you are able to create such merge statements in a Github environment.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_project_usage">Project usage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our projects our team should mainly use the squash and fast forward technique.
Therefore no "ugly" merge commits are getting created and your version history stays clean.
This vsh structure lets us work a bit different though.
As you create one singular "feature commit", your version history looses the somaller changes in between.
This not only lets us think about the size of commits bat rather when to create Prs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Our Guideline:</code>
- Try to regularly update the dev branch and keep features as small as possible.
- Try to keep commits as small as possible
- Only create Pull Requests when your inner workflow is no longer relevant for the applications development.
- Carefully Read through pull requests of others so that you can help them making that decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pull Requests generally just pass if your build works. <strong>Check that before you create them.</strong>
<code>(If that should happen you can simply commit again onto that branch. Your PR will update automatically)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To keep yourself committed to these rules make sure to have a local pull strategy of fast-forward.
This prevents the git system to cause merge commits when pulling in remote changes into your branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git config --global pull.rebase true</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_how_to_use_git_in_github">How to use git in Github</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git system has around 152 commands in total (1.7.11.3)
Normally you will face around 30 of them which are known under the name "Porcelain" commands.
Any other command runs under the term "Plumbing command" and will only be used when digging deep into the systems core features.
For the sake of simplicity we will mostly focus on those basic "Porcelain" Commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are four types of branch names.
The two protected and immutable ones are <code>dev</code> and <code>main</code>.
They are singularly staging areas for the Application, defining its state.
While dev is a general development area with mostly finished features, <code>main</code> includes only production ready code peaces. <strong>Keep that in mind while working!</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For development purposes you will only face two types of branches.
- feature branches</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feature branches are always based of of <code>dev</code> or in extremely rare cases on another feature branch.
Their content should include only kontent from a predefined github issue.
As their content is linked to the issue definition we found that indexing such branches is way easier when including the Issue Ticket number into the branch name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><strong>Ticketnumber is always three Digits</strong></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><strong>BEST PRACTICE:</strong></strong>
Use this template to create the ticket:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>feature#023/socia-ticketing-system</code></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>bug/hotfix branches</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bug and Hotfixes are no actual features but rather code fixtures or completions of previous features mistakes.
Their difference beeing that Hotfixes are direct reactions on top of the <code>main</code> branch and Bugfixes are made from the <code>dev</code> branch.

<h3 id="_accessing_the_correct_registry">Accessing the Correct Registry</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our case the normal Registry of github is not the way to go. Because of more advanced features of git servers, especially CICD related, we decided to move to a privately hosted instance of Gitea.
You do not need to remove your remote connection that currently exists to Github.
Rather than deleting the old one we will create a second entry in our "remote" entries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might know the syntax from adding remote access such as :</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ git init
$ git remote add origin [registrylink]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example the keyword origin is not actually a magic keyword but rather the default naming of a remote repository reference.
All we have to do is add our new repository (preferrably with a name like "gitea")</p>
